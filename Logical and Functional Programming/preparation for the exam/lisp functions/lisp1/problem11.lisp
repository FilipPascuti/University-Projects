;; 11.
;; a) Determine the least common multiple of the numerical values of a nonlinear list.
;; b) Write a function to test if a linear list of numbers has a "mountain" aspect (a list has a "mountain"
;; aspect if the items increase to a certain point and then decreases.
;;  Eg. (10 18 29 17 11 10). The list must have at least 3 atoms to fullfil this criteria.
;; c) Remove all occurrences of a maximum numerical element from a nonlinear list.
;; d) Write a function which returns the product of numerical even atoms from a list, to any level.

;; I had this as homework for Lab Lisp1
